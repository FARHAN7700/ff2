🗂 File: index.html
📝 Summary: The old code was just an exclamation point (!), which is not valid HTML.  The new code is a complete, albeit minimal, HTML5 document.  The change added the necessary structure for an HTML page including the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` elements, along with meta information like character set and viewport settings.


🗂 File: style.css
📝 Summary: Please provide the "Old" and "New" code snippets you wish me to compare.  I need the code to be able to give you a summary of the changes.
